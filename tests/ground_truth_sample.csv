And here we can look to a really interesting study title of which is time course of tolerance to the performance effects of caffeine. And what I like about this study is that while yes, it does say that abstaining from caffeine and then returning to caffeine intake can enhance physical performance in a very specific way. It also says that if you take caffeine regularly, you can still see the physical performance enhancing effects of caffeine, although they are not quite as robust as they would be had you abstained from caffeine. The design of the study is pretty straightforward. They had people either ingest three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days. Many people are already doing that I realize, but they had people do that or ensure that they were doing that. Or others ingested a placebo for 20 days, so they abstained from caffeine without realizing it. And after that 20 days of either ingesting caffeine or a placebo, their peak performance was measured in terms of aerobic output, but prior to that measurement they had caffeine.

Correct. You didn't have to move to do it. And in a lot of ways this has parallels to the ease of highly processed foods or something like that. And I think we're starting to understand this a bit through Jonathan Heights' work and other people's work, including your own, but I don't know that it's anything but really dangerous and bad. I don't want to sound alarmist, but I am really concerned that certainly for the younger generation, but that if we don't have an intrinsic drive to go do something, we stop doing it.

And then, of course, where you are all familiar with the skin, and that it responds to pressure, light touch, tickle, it shits, et cetera. What I'm understanding, based on what you're telling me, is that all along the pathway from our mouth to our rectum, we have sensory cells that are evaluating the chemical constituents of the foods that we eat.

So let's talk about epilepsy and how the ketogenic diet is not just used for epilepsy, but is one of the oldest, if not the oldest examples of the use of nutrition to treat a condition of the nervous system that can be incredibly debilitating even deadly. And the reality is that this literature and this clinical history and all of the research we have was the gods and that I needed to do the work that I'm doing otherwise I would have been discredited on day one. Chris Palmer's claiming that a dietary change can influence schizophrenia or schizophrenia effect of disorder that's impossible and he's a quack. But the thing that immediately got me credibility was I didn't focus on it as a diet. I did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature, so the ketogenic diet unbeknownst to most people was actually developed a hundred years ago in 1921 by a physician for one and only one purpose to treat epilepsy. It wasn't developed as a weight loss diet, it wasn't developed as the diet that all human beings should follow.

Before you begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. The first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium magnesium and potassium, and the correct ratios, but no sugar. We should all know that proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function. In fact, even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish your cognitive and physical performance to a considerable degree.

Create Your Ideal Future Using Science-Based Protocols | Ari Wallach,"resonate for me, because yesterday could have been an amazing day. You might not be as good as yesterday. Every day is kind of its own unique unit. And our biology really does function on the circadian biology units of 24 hours, so no negotiating that. So I like this concept of what can I do today to make my life and hopefully the lives of others better? Because it implies a verb and action step, and it's really focused on the unit of the day, which is really what we've got. So that resonated.

The other point that you bring up about, okay, what causes fascination to be captured, or why does something capture involuntary attention in a softly fascinating way? And that gets really interesting, where we think it could be elements of the structure of nature. So it's interesting, Andrew, that we can get these effects of nature improving cognitive performance. People just looking at pictures of nature versus looking at pictures of urban scenes, listening to nature sounds versus listening to urban sounds, watching nature videos versus watching urban videos. So there you don't have to worry about getting hit by a car. There's something about the visual aesthetic of nature that we think is producing some of those benefits that somehow our brain may be processes that fractal stimulation in more efficient or easier ways than kind of what you were talking about the 90 degree angled built environment that we've constructed.

And then if I kept up those behaviors consistently, and I was consistently adding in these other, let's just call them what they are, dopamine, releasing or stimulating behaviors and substances, that my enthusiasm for physical training, or running, or for doing experiments actually started to diminish. And this was really discouraging to me at the time because I started to think, okay, maybe I'm burnt out, maybe I have a adrenal burnout, which by the way, doesn't exist, folks. Your adrenals don't burn out. There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome. You can over-stimulate your system by way of too much adrenaline, or up in effort, but that's a separate thing. There's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se. But I didn't know that. So I thought, gosh, I'm really burnt out. When in fact, it's now obvious to me what I was doing. I was combining too many dopamine releasing or stimulating behaviors and substances, for things that I already enjoyed doing as behaviors, namely exercise and doing experiments, anything related to science actually.

GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: Protocols to Improve Your Sleep,"it very hard to get quality sleep as indicated by sleep trackers, and just late and seek a fall asleep as longer than it is, et cetera. So I've opted to eat most of my carbohydrates later in the evening, which violates every rule of, you know, eat your carbs early in the day. And I think there are some data to support that eating carbohydrates early in the day may actually have certain benefits for weight maintenance or weight loss. So I realized that, but those are my goals at the moment, I weight maintenance, yes, weight loss, no. So I think I certainly feel after eating a dinner that has a bit more starch, pasta, rice, these things of that sort. And a little bit lower protein as opposed to the inverse, like eating a couple of rice sticks and a salad. But no starch that my sleep is substantially better. And I always attributed that to the relationship between some of these starches and the trip to fans slash their tone and palute.

There's a very lengthy and very interesting review entitled vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections. Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data. This is a beast of a thing. I did read it all, very, very interesting many, many studies. The exact takeaways from a large review like this of 25 randomized controlled trials is a little bit tricky. I mean, they did conclude that vitamin D supplementation did reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all the participants. However, the degree of prevention was small to moderate in some cases. They did point out, however, that just because people with low levels of vitamin D tend to get colds and flues, more often than people that don't, does not necessarily mean that vitamin D deficiencies are the reason for that. For instance, we know that people that get regular sunlight exposure. And as everyone knows, I'm a big, big proponent of getting sunlight in your eyes as early as possible in the day after waking up.

And that is a very powerful way for a, let's just call it a quitting method to work because, as I've always said, the most powerful schedule of dopamine is going to be this random intermittent reward. This is what's used in the casinos in order to take your money and generally they do on average, they take your money more than you take theirs and they take more of it, not just more often, because they use this random intermittent schedule.

Your adrenals don't burn out. There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome. You can over-stimulate your system by way of too much adrenaline, or up in effort, but that's a separate thing. There's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se. But I didn't know that. So I thought, gosh, I'm really burnt out. When in fact, it's now obvious to me what I was doing.

It also says that if you take caffeine regularly, you can still see the physical performance enhancing effects of caffeine, although they are not quite as robust as they would be had you abstained from caffeine. The design of the study is pretty straightforward. They had people either ingest three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days. Many people are already doing that I realize, but they had people do that or ensure that they were doing that. Or others ingested a placebo for 20 days, so they abstained from caffeine without realizing it.

First of all, in the experiment done in animals, they found there's a model of learned helpnesses in animals. It's not very kind to the animals, but they put rats or mice in a jar. They let them swim, and they'll swim, swim, swim, to try and save their life, and eventually they give up. It's a learned help with this. They don't let them drown, they take them out. Adjusting the omega-3 omega-6 ratio so that the omega-3s are higher, lead to less learned helplessness, meaning these animals would swim longer. But that same study was essentially done in humans.
